## Ontology sources
The ontology is provided in different formats in the folder `sources`. You can open it with a text editor or using an ontology editor, f.e. [Protégé ](https://protege.stanford.edu/)

##### For a better readability:  
1) In Protégé-Editor open: "File" -> Preferences.
2) In the tab "Renderer" choose "Render by annotation property"


## Running the ontology documentation
The documentation for the ontology can be started locally as a web application:
1. Install `http-server`. F.e using npm: 
  *  install Node.js
  *  run `npm install http-server -g`
2. Clone the project, go to the project directory `documentation`.
3. Run `http-server -p 8081 -c-1` and go to the http://localhost:8081/index-en.html (documentation) or http://localhost:8081/webvowl/ (visualization).
